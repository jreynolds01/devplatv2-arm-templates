# NOTES

examining why there may be a difference between yaml deployment and ARM deployment. Looks like yml may be translated to 
to json -> str before getting submitted

```
less /opt/az/extensions/ml/azext_mlv2/manual/vendored_curated_sdk/azure/ml/entities/_assets/environment.py
# look for yaml.dump(self.conda_file)
# from azext_mlv2.manual.vendored_curated_sdk.azure.ml._utils.utils import load_yaml, 
# from azext_mlv2.manual.vendored_curated_sdk.azure.ml._restclient.v2021_03_01_preview.models
```


```python3
import yaml
with open('test-environment.yml','r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

yaml.dump(data)
```

`yaml.dump` just prints out basically the yaml format from the dict (some missing whitespace)


# preprocessing
BEFORE checking in - removed sub ids, RG names, and WS names, mostly in ARM outputs....
